  This project pulls stock information from the IEXTrading API and displays the data in table format for the user. 
  Information such as: stock symbol(aapl,goog, etc.), company name, company logo, and current stock price. 
  User may enter any stock symbol of their choice in the textbox and the basic stock information
  of each symbol will be returned. 
  Some desired functionality may be missing due to lack of time.
  Project is maintained by myself (Kyle Cuccatti) as this project is my own.
